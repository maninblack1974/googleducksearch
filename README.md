# Cucumber/Selenium - Rspec/Faraday Code Samples for Aspiration QA Team
Wrote tests to search Google for duck using Cucumber/Selenium with Ruby. Included with those was another sample using RSpec/Faraday that was to perform a GET on https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.

Note: I have not used Ruby previously and tried to self teach for these specific scenarios over the last 3 days to complete the code. This code has not been executed as I was just trying to complete the code and turn it in a timely matter.
